    "Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "You will test Ohm’s law using the data you collect by calculating the resistance value at each setting and comparing the spread in values against the uncertainty in the measurements. A simple test is to check that your R values all fall within the uncertainty of their average value. If that’s true, then you might have enough evidence to conclude that Ohm’s law is true for the resistor you chose.\n",
    "In the next exercise you will need to use Python to fit a model to the data you collect.\n",
    "Finally, the multimeter offers an Ohmmeter mode that measures the resistance using a single voltage. Compare this measurement (and uncertainty) with your derived value for resistance (and uncertainty). If they are different, find a possible reason for the difference.\n",

    "Analysis with Python\n",
    "For this experiment, you will use Python to fit the data you collect to find the power-law relationship for the lightbulb. In your fitting code you should try fitting the power-law model and the logarithmic version. You can also add an ‘idealized’ model to your analysis by fitting I = aV 3/5 and finding the value of a needed.3\n",
    "Your Python program should perform the following steps\n",
    "1. Import the necessary modules and functions (e.g., numpy and curve fit).\n",
    "2. Read the data into suitable arrays, likely using the loadtxt function.\n",
    "3. Calculate any missing parameters, uncertainties, and constants you need.\n",
    "4. Define a suitable model function (e.g., f (V ) = aV b + c).\n",
    "5. Use curve fit to find the best fit parameters\n",
    "6. Convert the output from curve fit into physical parameters.\n",
    "7. Plot the data with uncertainties, the best fit curve/line\n",
    "8. Plot the residual from measurements to fitted model, and calculate the χ2 fitting metric.\n",
    "After you fit with your models you should have the collected data and several different predictions to plot on a single plot. The data you collect should be plotted as separate points with error bars. The model predictions can be plotted as lines but you should make an effort to make all of the model lines visible and identifiable.\n",
    "Plot the three models you fit on 1 plot with linear axes. The linear axes empha- size the larger values and you can compare the different fits at the higher voltages. You should also plot an identical plot but with logarithmic axes, which emphasizes the lower voltages. Logarithmic plots can be made in matplotlib using plt.xscale(’log’) and plt.yscale(’log’) to convert the axes to logarithms without changing the data."
